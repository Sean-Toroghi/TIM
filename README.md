# TIM
Toolkit for Resilience Measurement

The Toolkit for Resilience Measaurement (TIM) softare is developed to enhance the use of metric framework proposed by Sean Toroghi and Dr. Valerie Thomas. The framework was introduced in 2019, and more detailed information is avalable through a paper submitted to the "Reliability Engineering & System Safety" journal. TIM computes five dimensions of resilience (Robustness, Redundancy, Resourcefulness, Rapidity, and Readjust-ability) and overal resilience capacity of an electric infrastructure system. 

Two versions of TIM are developed for the Windows and Macintosh operation systems. To run the application, no other software is needed to be pre-installed.  To run the software, user need to download the appropriate zip file subject to the operation system, unzip the file, and run TIM.
